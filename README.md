# radar-object-classification
This is supervised learning technique where model is trained using labelled data (Car, Van, Truck, Pedestrian). 
When unlabelled data is provided to the model to predict, it would predict the model accurately.
Different models are used here to increase the accuracy as well as to avoid overfitting.
